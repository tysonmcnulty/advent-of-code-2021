# Day 6: Lanternfish
# Each lanternfish creates a new fish every 7 days

# -read initial list of fish ages (one line in a text file)
# -write population of fish to a history list
# -each day: (1) decrease ages by 1;
#   (2) if 0, add a new fish age 8 & rotate 0 to 6;
#   (3) write population to the history list
# -data structure: two lists of integers: fish ages & population history
# -solution to Part 1: population after 80 days
#  TODO: for big numbers, use a dict of age counts instead of inefficient list!
# -solution to Part 2: population after 256 days
